HangmanGame
===========

Its a hangman game I have been developing off and on for a couple of months in my spare time
there are multiple versions of the game with HangmanSin+Mul being the most recent one.
I am currently working on rewriting this program so that it functions in OOP but properly. If anyone wants to take 
a look at it and make changes feel free
